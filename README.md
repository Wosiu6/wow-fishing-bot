# An app that automates fishing in wow

## How does it work?
This is a sound-driven fish bot that uses the interact button (introduced in DF) to cast/reel in fish in wow using only the output sound. 

In theory, it would be possible to repurpose this software in other games/scenarios. Lost Ark could be quite similar in terms of mechanics. Options in the software let you change the config. good luck.

## Running the project

### In-game setup
You will need some addon to bind the fishing/interaction button to. The default is the dot ("."). Make sure to mute all sounds in your game and leave only the fishing on. There are weakauras to achieving this, you can use an addon or just mute everything in game other than the environment (I think, but not sure).
The rest is self-explanatory, there are calibration options in the "Edit" context menu button. You can observe your volume levels to adjust it accordingly.
