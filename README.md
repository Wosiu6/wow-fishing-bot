# Fishing-Bot-World-of-Warcraft

## How does it work?
This is a sound driven fish bot that uses interact button (introduced in DF) to cast/reel in fish in wow using only the output sound. 

In theory, it would be possible to repurpose this software in other games/scenarios. Lost ark could is quite similar in terms of mechanics. Options in the software let you change the config. good luck.

## Running the project

### In game setup
You will need some sort of addon to bind fihsing/interaction button to. Default is the dot ("."). Make sure to mute all sounds in your game and leave only the fishing on. There are weakauras to achieve this, you can use an addon or just mute everything in game other than environment (I think, not sure).
Rest is self explanatory, there are calibration options in the "Edit" context menu button. You can observe your volume levels to adjust it accordignly.
